# Bethesda.Net launcher helper
Something I've put together for my future Lutris script for Fallout 76 that works around an issue (as of december 6th 
2018 with Wine 3.21) where installing any game on Bethesda.Net launcher. All it does is checking if the launcher wants 
torename one precise file, which for some reason it can't rename, then rename it itself.
